//! Draws the native fee asset from the node's funding service, which owns one account and hands out
//! pay-to-ID notes over an HTTP API. It is the only source of that asset the suite has.
//!
//! The service gathers every request that reaches it inside a short window into one transaction. A
//! caller therefore asks for all of its accounts at once, so that they share that transaction, and
//! so do the accounts of every other test process funding at the same moment.
//!
//! The service answers with the note before it builds the transaction which creates the note. Every
//! funding note is consumed as an unauthenticated input, so no test waits for the funding
//! transaction to commit. A test can submit its own transaction before the funding transaction
//! reaches the node. The test client's RPC layer resubmits such a rejected transaction (see
//! `miden_client::testing::submit_retry`).
