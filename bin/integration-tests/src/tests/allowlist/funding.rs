//! Funding for the accounts the allowlist tests do not register.
//!
//! A registration makes the node pay the account through its funding service. An unregistered
//! account also needs the native asset, because the client executes a deploy before it asks the
//! node whether the account is allowlisted, and on a fee-charging chain the execution fails when
//! the vault cannot pay the fee. The tests pay such an account with a direct request to the same
//! service, which `scripts/start-test-node.sh` starts when it is started with
//! `MIDEN_ACCOUNT_ALLOWLIST=1`. The account then receives the same public note a registration
//! gives, so every account in these tests deploys the same way.
