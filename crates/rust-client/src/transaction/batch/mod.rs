//! Stacks multiple transactions across one or more local accounts and submits them as one proven
//! batch via the node's `SubmitProvenBatch` endpoint.
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! 1. Open a builder with [`Client::new_transaction_batch`](crate::Client::new_transaction_batch).
//! 2. Add transactions via [`BatchBuilder::push`]. The first push targeting an account lazily loads
//!    its current state from the store; later pushes for that same account see the post-state of
//!    the previous push.
//! 3. Finalize with [`BatchBuilder::submit`]. This assembles a `ProposedBatch`, proves it, submits
//!    it to the node, and atomically applies the per-transaction updates to the local store.
//!
//! ## Multi-account semantics
//!
//! Each `push` specifies which local account the transaction targets. A single batch can contain
//! transactions from any combination of local accounts. Per-account in-memory state stacks for
//! repeated pushes against the same account.
//!
//! ## In-batch cross-account note flow
//!
//! A transaction in the batch may consume a note produced by an earlier transaction in the same
//! batch — even if the producer and consumer target different accounts. The user extracts the
//! expected output note from the producing request via
//! [`TransactionRequest::expected_output_own_notes`] and feeds it as an input to the consuming
//! request. Push order must respect producer-before-consumer.
//!
//! ## Constraints
//!
//! - All accounts pushed into the batch must be tracked by the client's store (otherwise the first
//!   push for that account fails with [`crate::ClientError::AccountDataNotFound`]).
//! - Locked accounts are rejected with [`crate::ClientError::AccountLocked`].
//! - No two transactions in a batch may consume the same input note (rejected with
//!   [`BatchBuilderError::DuplicateInputNote`]).
//! - A failed [`push`](BatchBuilder::push) leaves the batch exactly as it was, so the caller may
//!   retry with a different request or submit the transactions accumulated so far.
//!
//! ## Account allowlist
//!
//! [`BatchBuilder::submit`] asks the network allowlist about each account that the batch creates
//! before the batch is proven. It fails with [`crate::ClientError::AccountNotAllowlisted`] if the
//! network does not accept one of them. [`Client::retry_proven_batch`] does not ask again.
//!
//! ## Error semantics around submission
//!
//! A submission that comes back without a definite outcome raises
//! [`BatchBuilderError::BatchSubmissionOutcomeUnknown`]. The node may or may not have accepted the
//! batch and nothing was recorded locally, so the error carries a [`ProvenBatchSubmission`] to
//! resend with [`Client::retry_proven_batch`].
//!
//! Once the node accepts the batch, the local store still needs to be updated. If that step fails,
//! the caller receives one of two errors that both carry the accepted `block_num`:
//!
//! - [`BatchBuilderError::BatchSubmittedButUpdateBuildFailed`] — building one of the per-tx
//!   [`TransactionStoreUpdate`]s failed.
//! - [`BatchBuilderError::BatchSubmittedButApplyFailed`] — applying the updates atomically to the
//!   local store failed.
//!
//! In all three cases `sync_state` reconciles the accounts with what the network holds. It does not
//! create transaction records, though: syncing updates records the client already holds and never
//! inserts missing ones. For the unknown outcome an accepted retry writes them; for the two
//! post-accept errors nothing will, since neither carries the updates that failed.
