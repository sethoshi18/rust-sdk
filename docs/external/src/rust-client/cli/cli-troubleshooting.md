## Troubleshooting and transaction lifecycle (CLI)

This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues and understand the end-to-end lifecycle of transactions and notes in the Miden client.

### TL;DR checklist

> Note: This section applies to the Miden CLI client. Guidance for the Rust and Web clients may differ.

- Ensure you have a proper configuration setup: either a global config at `~/.miden/miden-client.toml` or a local config at `./.miden/miden-client.toml`. Local config takes priority if both exist.
- If you need a clean local state, delete the SQLite store file referenced by `store_filepath` (default: `.miden/store.sqlite3`). It will be recreated automatically on the next command.
- Verify your node RPC endpoint is reachable and correct in your configuration file (local `.miden/miden-client.toml` or global `~/.miden/miden-client.toml`).
- Run `miden-client sync` to refresh local state after errors involving missing data or outdated heights.
- On a network that enforces an account allowlist, register a new account with `miden-client account --register <ID> --invitation-code <CODE>` before its first transaction, then `sync` to receive the funding note the network pays it.

### Typical CLI outputs

```sh
# Force non-interactive submission (e.g., CI)
miden-client transfer --force ...

# Refresh local state
miden-client sync
```

If you see a gRPC error, it may include a status-derived kind (e.g. `Unavailable`, `InvalidArgument`) which narrows possible causes.

### Common errors and how to resolve

Below are representative errors you may encounter, their likely causes, and suggested fixes.

#### `RpcError.GrpcError: Unavailable` / `DeadlineExceeded`
- Cause: Node is down, unreachable, or behind a load balancer that blocked the request.
- Fix: Check `rpc.endpoint` in your configuration file (local `.miden/miden-client.toml` or global `~/.miden/miden-client.toml`), verify the node is running/accessible, and retry.

#### `RpcError.InvalidArgument` / `ExpectedDataMissing` / `InvalidResponse`
- Cause: Malformed request parameters or unexpected server response.
- Fix: Re-check command flags/inputs. If using partial IDs, ensure they map to a single entity. Update to the latest client if the server API has changed.

#### Client/network compatibility mismatch
- Cause: Client and network versions or the genesis header commitment are incompatible.
- Symptoms: CLI may report messages like:

  ```
  accept header validation failed: server rejected request - please check your version and network settings
  ```

  or requests being rejected due to a mismatched genesis header commitment.
- Details: These are validated by the node by verifying client headers on gRPC requests.
- Fix: Ensure your client version matches the target network. Switch to the correct network or upgrade/downgrade the client accordingly. Verify the configured genesis header commitment matches the network, then retry.

#### `ClientError.AccountDataNotFound(<account_id>)`
- Cause: The account is not known to the local store yet.
- Fix: Create/import the account first, or run `miden-client sync` to fetch it if it exists on-chain.

#### `ClientError.AccountLocked(<account_id>)`
- Cause: Attempting to modify a locked account.
- Fix: Unlock or use another account as appropriate.

#### `ClientError.AccountNotAllowlisted(<account_id>)`
- Cause: The network enforces an account allowlist, and the transaction would create an account that is not registered on it. Only the first transaction of an account is affected. Network accounts are exempt.
- Fix: Register the account with `miden-client account --register <ID> --invitation-code <CODE>`, using the invitation code the network operator gave you, then run `miden-client sync` and submit the transaction again. See [Registering an account on the network allowlist](index.md#registering-an-account-on-the-network-allowlist).

#### `invitation code does not exist` / `the invitation code or the account is already registered`
- Cause: The node does not know the invitation code, the code is bound to a different account, or the account is already registered. Codes are case-sensitive and bind to one account only.
- Fix: Send the code exactly as you received it. If the account is already registered, no action is needed. Run `miden-client sync` to receive the funding note the network may have paid it.

#### `RpcError.GrpcError: Unavailable` after `account --register`
- Cause: The node registered the account, but the funding service that pays registered accounts failed.
- Fix: The account stays registered, so a retry fails with `AccountAlreadyAllowed`. Fund the account another way, for example through a faucet, then create it on chain by consuming a note.

#### `ClientError.AccountAlreadyAllowed(<account_id>)`
- Cause: The node already allows the account, because it is registered or because the network does not enforce an allowlist. The invitation code was not sent.
- Fix: No registration is needed. Keep the code for a different account, and run `miden-client sync` to receive the funding note the network may have paid a registered account.

#### `ClientError.StoreError(AccountCommitmentAlreadyExists(...))`
- Cause: Trying to apply a transaction whose final account commitment is already present locally.
- Fix: Ensure you are not re-applying the same transaction. Sync and check transaction status.

#### `ClientError.NoteNotFoundOnChain(<note_id>)` / `RpcError.NoteNotFound(<note_id>)`
- Cause: The note has not been published/committed yet or the ID is incorrect.
- Fix: Verify the note ID. If it should exist, run `miden-client sync` and retry.

#### `ClientError.TransactionInputError` / `TransactionScriptError`
- Cause: Invalid transaction inputs, script logic errors, or failing constraints.
- Fix: Validate input notes, foreign accounts, and script assumptions.

#### `ClientError.TransactionProvingError`
- Cause: Local proving failed or remote prover returned an error.
- Fix: If using remote proving, verify `remote_prover_endpoint` is reachable and add `--delegate-proving`. Check prover logs.

#### Recency/block delta errors
- Cause: Client is too far behind the network and validation enforces a max delta.
- Fix: Run `miden-client sync` or increase `max_block_number_delta` via `miden-client init --block-delta <N>` and re-run.

### Transaction lifecycle (CLI-oriented overview)

For the full protocol-level lifecycle, see the Miden book: [Transaction lifecycle](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/smart-contracts/transactions/introduction#transaction-lifecycle).

    A[Build Request] --> B[Validate Request]
    A -.->|optional| C[Collect/Insert Input Notes]
    A -.->|optional| D[Load Foreign Accounts]
    B -.->|optional| K[Insert Public Note Recipients]
    B --> E[Execute Transaction]
    E --> F[Prove Transaction]
    F --> G[Submit to Node]
    G --> H[Track Locally]

    subgraph Tracking
      H --> I[Update Account State]
      H --> J[Update Notes/Tags]
    end
```

Key states the CLI surfaces:

- Transaction status: `Pending` (after execution), `Committed` (after node inclusion), `Discarded` (not included).
- Input notes: `Expected` → `Processing` → `Consumed` (after sync) or `Committed` if fetched with inclusion.

### Configuration troubleshooting

#### Config priority confusion
- **Issue**: Unclear which configuration is being used (local vs global)
- **Check**: Run commands from different directories to see if behavior changes
- **Local priority**: If `./.miden/miden-client.toml` exists, it overrides `~/.miden/miden-client.toml`
- **Fix**: Use `miden-client clear-config` to remove unwanted configurations, or `miden-client clear-config --global` to remove only global config. Note: Running `miden-client clear-config` without flags follows priority: if a local .miden folder exists, it removes only that one; if no local folder exists, it removes the global one. Use `--global` to specifically target the global configuration regardless of local config presence.

#### Clean configuration reset
- **Complete reset**: Use `miden-client clear-config` to remove the active configuration (follows priority: local first, then global)
- **Selective reset**: Use `miden-client clear-config --global` to remove only global configuration while preserving local
- **Fresh start**: After clearing, run `miden-client init` (global) or `miden-client init --local` (local) to recreate

### Recovery flow

1. Verify `rpc.endpoint` connectivity and timeouts.
2. Run `miden-client sync` to refresh local headers/notes.
3. If local DB is inconsistent for development purposes, delete the store file (`.miden/store.sqlite3` in local config or `~/.miden/store.sqlite3` in global config) and retry.
5. For configuration issues, use `miden-client clear-config` to reset config and `miden-client init` to recreate.
6. Adjust `max_block_number_delta` if strict recency checks block validation.
7. If proving errors persist with a remote prover, confirm `remote_prover_endpoint` and consider running locally to isolate the issue.
